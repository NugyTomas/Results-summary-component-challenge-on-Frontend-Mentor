## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Bootstrap 5.3


### What I learned

I learned to google ALOT. There is a lot of help on stackkflow for boostrap 4, but not so much for Bootstrap 5.3 so I had to try and go through a lot of their documents, but it was worth it!

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**
